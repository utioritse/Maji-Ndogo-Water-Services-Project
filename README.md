# Water Services Project

Maji Ndogo is a fictional country in Africa. Their newly elected president, Aziza Naledi, is determined to tackle many of the countryâ€™s challenges, including its water crisis. She has recruited a team of Data Analysts to ensure the project is data-led. After letting go of corrupt surveyors and visiting water sources nationwide, the project is ready to kick off and President Naledi wants to have an idea of the cost on a national and provincial level.
